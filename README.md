# my-imageboard
This is a custom imageboard I created using Vichan running on an Ubuntu virtual machine. I have learned how to debug server errors using Linux, the commands of Linux terminals, PHP configuration, databases of MySQL, and front end customization.

 Features
- Custom homepage layout  
- Custom CSS theme  
- Configuration of boards according to their topic at hand  
- PHP + MySQL backend  
- Basic moderation tools enabled (deletion of posts that violate the rules, banning of users)  
- Anonymous posting (can type a custom name in the bar before making their post if they wish)
