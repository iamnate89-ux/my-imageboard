# my-imageboard
This is a custom imageboard I created using Vichan running on an Ubuntu virtual machine.

 Features
- Custom homepage layout  
- Custom CSS theme  
- Configuration of boards according to their topic at hand  
- PHP + MySQL backend  
- Basic moderation tools enabled (deletion of posts that violate the rules, banning of users)  
- Anonymous posting (can type a custom name in the bar before making their post if they wish)

What I have learned
- Debug server errors using Linux
- The commands of Linux terminals
-  PHP configuration
-  databases of MySQL
-  front end customization
-  How to create a local server to run a website

Improvements I can make (possible upcoming features)
- Add rotating banners
- Create more boards for diverse topics
- Add specific rules for different boards
- Make and configure the catalog page (FIXED)
- Add custom themes the user can select
- Add CAPTCHA verification

Challenges / errors I faced
- Setting up the local server (had to create an Ubuntu virtual machine since Windows did not work)
- Installing vichan (fixed issues with creating the root file, vendor folder in the terminal)
- Adding a logo (fixed with finding the index.php file in the terminal)
- Setting up rotating banners (still in progress)
